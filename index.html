    <p id="introduction"> Welcome! Feel comfortable, rejoyce in this bare (and under construction) webspace, proudly self hosted for free on Github, and put together with the help of Almighty Chatgpt 3.5 during some dark days in November 2023.</p>

    <p id="introduction"> My work will be listed in here, as well as links, other resources and relevant documents. In case you don't know me, I am Andrés, a generalist game developer, occasionally coding, mostly devoting my professional and personal time to the tools surrounding the medium of videogames. I draw, model, animate, compose, and program. Lately I research VR, and work mostly with Blender and Unity.</p>

        <p>Maybe the most honest realization for me about working has been how thrilling is to learn something. The satisfaction of research, problem solving, and enabling oneself and others to create things.</p>

        <p>I have repeatedly been intrigued with the technical knowledge around the disciplines I get involved with. The techniques and processes of a practice seem directly related with how freely you can  move in that space.</p>

        <p>And isn't that the point, at the end, to gather as much freedom as we can, to enable as much freedom around us as possible? Maybe that has become an obsession of mine, and maybe certain aspects about it have inspired my taste for gathering things in my practice. And when I say gathering, I mean to keep opening doors to new tools, new languages, new paths. I am not sure if that is actually furthering the freedom of mine or those around me, but it certainly is fun. And play is maybe another obsession. But going back to the gathering: It is becoming clear that all languages have things in common. Not only because all of our practices have roots that are connected, but also because we keep coming back to the same things over and over, no matter which tools we have around.
        </p>

        <p>There is also a point to be made about how far away realities inform each other, complement. At some point in order to progress with your drawing, you need to study sculpting. The mathematics of shaders and programming are greatly related with music. All of this to excuse my manic jumping around.
        </p>

        <p>Anyways, you could always say "look, all that is nice, but we have limited time, and limited resources. And I'm already tired" and I totally agree.</p>
