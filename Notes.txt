This is a note pad, where I will keep some notes for things:

-Break points interesting for styling
------------------
/* Styles for desktop */
/* For screens 992px and above */
@media (min-width: 992px) {
    /* Desktop styles */
    /* ... */
}

/* Styles for tablets */
/* For screens between 768px and 991px */
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) {
    /* Tablet styles */
    /* ... */
}

/* Styles for mobile */
/* For screens below 768px */
@media (max-width: 767px) {
    /* Mobile styles */
    /* ... */
}
-------------------
-CSS based on percentages

When working with responsive design, breakpoints aren't limited to pixels; you can utilize various units, including percentages, ems, rems, and viewport units (like vw and vh), to create responsive layouts based on relative sizes rather than fixed pixels.

For instance, you can use percentages or viewport units as breakpoints in media queries:

css

/* Styles for screens wider than 768 pixels */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    /* Styles here */
}

/* Styles for screens smaller than 50% of the viewport width */
@media (max-width: 50%) {
    /* Styles here */
}

/* Styles for screens wider than 60% of the viewport height */
@media (min-height: 60vh) {
    /* Styles here */
}
