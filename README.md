# Creating a web portfolio with Chatgpt

I am not a developer by training, and my objective here is simple: Chatgpt is maybe the biggest, richest, and most interactive piece of compiled human knowledge. And I am using it to learn.

## About AI and ethics

You could say AI is *the* new format for knowledge accesibility. And the same way that there is bias in an encyclopedia, from who decided which knowledge gets in, to who decided which pieces of information get colored photos on the side. The same happens with AI, and the sole fact that AI is utilized for profit without consideration of those that built the huge libraries of knowledge they are based on is the ultimate theft.

    - Oh, but the Industry is stealing your work everyday?
    
              -Yes DUH, but at least pays my bills, creates a safespace for me to develop my skills, and so on

I do not think AI should be banned, demonized, or pointed at as "the evil" in here. As a tool, like many before, it allows for things that hasn't been possible before. It is therefore what we utilize these tools for that makes up for a good outcome (learning, knowledge dissemination, democratization of tools and languages, etc.) and a bad outcome (replacement of human-created content with AI-generated content).

Power holders (industry leaders, managers, corporate, investors) are effectively the architects of the industries that function with the work of all of us. And there is plenty of possibilities for wrong happening in here. Because all the cases will be different, and the relationships with those powerholders as well will differ on every case; I will just make two remarks to conclude this introduction:

  1. Critical thinking is key. No technological leap overwrites our human reality, or justifies the abuse of a group of humans over others. Tech lords are *a mistake*, the same way that medieval lords were. Too much power on a pair of human hands can only create a bunch of problems for everyone else. The fact that other power holders will attach to each other in order to maintain their priviledged positions and battle and compete against other power holders is just the human circus we live in.

  2. Intellectual property is a business, and like any business, it works out better the more money you have. If you are an individual with remarkable creations but no power network protecting it; their valuable resources will be stolen by entities that can afford legal battles and win over them. These laws are meant to secure corporate profit. Artists can only hope, and in some few cases manage to claim their rights over their creations. All of this to say that fencing our property with perfect walls so that no one can touch our work and ideas is the corporate fantasy of copyrights, and human creations have little to do with this logic: Our creations are always the product of collaborative efforts. And education is at the base of this.

To conclude, the usage of AI systems to navigate knowledge with natural language, to translate any format (visual, video, text) into any other format/language; has opened the doors of realtime meta-collaboration. We not only build on top of previous knowledge, we interact with that knowledge conversationally: the librarian and the library are merged. Chatgpt articulates the knowledge of a portion of humanity and using it is as simple as talking. The "surface" knowledge, or the "straightfoward" knowledg is about to reach every corner of the internet. 

Mysticism, fantasy, and curiosity remain our own abstract sources of meaning.

That being said *(waoh, no one asked anything and I just puked a manifesto or something on my own, congratulations, me, you did it again)*, this repository is here to document the process, and introduce any interested person, to the usage of chatgpt for web creation.
A portfolio website contains the basics I need for this test: Information, text, documents, links, videos, and different interconnected pages.
